## Project Overview

This project aims to build a robust e-commerce application using Flutter. The project adheres to Clean Architecture, which promotes separation of concerns and makes the codebase easier to test and maintain.

## Architecture

The app follows Clean Architecture, dividing the project into distinct layers, each with its specific responsibilities:

### Domain Layer

The domain layer is the core of the application. It contains business logic that is independent of any frameworks or external systems. This layer includes:

- **Entities**: Core business objects that are used throughout the application.
- **Use Cases**: Business rules that define what operations can be performed in the application. They interact with the repository interfaces defined within the domain.
